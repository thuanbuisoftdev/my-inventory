# Helm Overview

## Introduction
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, enabling users to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications using reusable, configurable packages called charts.

## Concepts
### 1. Chart
A Helm chart is a collection of YAML templates that define a Kubernetes application. It includes configurations, dependencies, and the applicationâ€™s metadata.

### 2. Release
A release is an instance of a Helm chart installed in a Kubernetes cluster. Multiple releases of the same chart can coexist in different namespaces or with different configurations.

### 3. Values
Values are customizable parameters for a chart. They allow users to override default settings in the `values.yaml` file to customize deployments.

### 4. Repositories
Helm repositories store and distribute Helm charts. Popular public repositories include the official Helm Hub and ArtifactHub.

### 5. Tiller (Helm v2 - Deprecated)
Tiller was the server-side component of Helm v2 but was removed in Helm v3 to improve security and simplify architecture.

## Architecture Components
1. **Helm CLI**: The command-line interface used to interact with Helm.
2. **Chart**: The package format for Helm, containing Kubernetes resource definitions.
3. **Release**: A deployed instance of a Helm chart in a cluster.
4. **Values.yaml**: A configuration file used to override default settings in a Helm chart.
5. **Templates**: YAML templates that dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests based on values.
6. **Hooks**: Custom scripts that execute at different points in a release lifecycle (e.g., pre-install, post-delete).
7. **Repositories**: Storage locations for sharing and retrieving Helm charts.

## Use Cases
- Managing application deployments efficiently
- Simplifying version control for Kubernetes resources
- Handling application upgrades and rollbacks
- Enabling reusability and configuration management

## Best Practices
- Use values.yaml for configuration rather than hardcoding values.
- Store Helm charts in repositories for version control.
- Use `helm lint` to validate charts before deploying.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for security.
- Use Helm hooks carefully to manage lifecycle events.

## Conclusion
Helm simplifies Kubernetes application management by providing a templating system, version control, and easy upgrade/downgrade mechanisms. It is widely used in DevOps workflows to streamline deployments and ensure consistency across environments.
