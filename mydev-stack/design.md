# Architecture design

High-level structure of a system that defines how components interact, ensuring scalability, maintainability and performance

Types:

- Monilitic: All Components are tightly integrated into codebase
- Layered: Devides system into laygers, eg: MVC
- Microservices: Breaks system into small, independent services that comminucate over network
- Event-driven: Uses event for communication between components
- Serverless: Uses cloud-managed services instead of managing servers
- Hexagonal: Isolate bussiness from external dependencies
