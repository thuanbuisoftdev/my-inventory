Normalization: A design process to eliminate duplicates, maintain data integrity
1NF: Atomicity: colum contains indivisible value
2NF: No partial dependency: non-key columns should depend on primary key
3NF: No transitive dependency: non-key columns should direct depend on primary key
Denormalization: Constrast with normolization to improve read speed

# Non-relational database

- non-table data: document, column-wide, graphDB, key-value store
- popular databases: MongoDB(document), Casandra(column-wide), Neo4J(GrapDB) Redis(key-value)
