# Concurrency & parallelsm

Concurrency:

- one resource manage multiple tasks same time

parallel:

- many resources execute multiple tasks same time

Event loop:

- manage events/tasks asynchronously

# Python

Concurrency:

- Generators(yield) introduced the concept of pausing/resuming execution
- Coroutines(async/await) evolved from generator-based coroutines
