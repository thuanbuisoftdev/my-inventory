# Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview

## What is a StatefulSet?
A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes resource used to manage stateful applications that require **stable network identities, persistent storage, and ordered deployment & scaling**. It is commonly used for databases and distributed applications like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and Kafka**.

## StatefulSet vs. Deployment

### Pod Identity
- **StatefulSet**: Each Pod has a **unique, stable hostname** (e.g., `web-0`, `web-1`).
- **Deployment**: Pods are interchangeable and don't have fixed names.

### Scaling and Updates
- **StatefulSet**: Pods are created & deleted **one by one (ordered)**. Rolling updates are performed **one Pod at a time**.
- **Deployment**: Pods are created/deleted **in parallel**. Updates are performed in **any order**.

### Storage and Use Case
- **StatefulSet**: Uses **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** that retain data even if Pods restart. Suitable for databases and stateful applications (e.g., Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch).
- **Deployment**: Volumes are ephemeral unless explicitly defined. Ideal for stateless applications, web servers, and microservices.

## StatefulSet Lifecycle
1. **Creates Pods sequentially (`pod-0`, `pod-1`, etc.)**
2. **Assigns each Pod a stable network identity**
3. **Attaches a persistent volume to each Pod**
4. **Ensures Pods are deleted in reverse order when scaled down**
5. **Allows controlled rolling updates**

## When to Use a StatefulSet?
- When **each Pod needs a unique, stable identity**
- When **Pods require persistent storage that remains after restarts**
- When **order of scaling up/down matters**
