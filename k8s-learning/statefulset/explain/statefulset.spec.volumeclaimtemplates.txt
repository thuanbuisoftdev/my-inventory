FIELD: volumeClaimTemplates <[]PersistentVolumeClaim>


DESCRIPTION:
    volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed to reference.
    The StatefulSet controller is responsible for mapping network identities to
    claims in a way that maintains the identity of a pod. Every claim in this
    list must have at least one matching (by name) volumeMount in one container
    in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over any volumes in
    the template, with the same name.
    PersistentVolumeClaim is a user's request for and claim to a persistent
    volume
