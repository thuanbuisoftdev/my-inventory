KIND:       ServiceAccount
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: secrets <[]ObjectReference>


DESCRIPTION:
    Secrets is a list of the secrets in the same namespace that pods running
    using this ServiceAccount are allowed to use. Pods are only limited to this
    list if this service account has a "kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets"
    annotation set to "true". The "kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets"
    annotation is deprecated since v1.32. Prefer separate namespaces to isolate
    access to mounted secrets. This field should not be used to find
    auto-generated service account token secrets for use outside of pods.
    Instead, tokens can be requested directly using the TokenRequest API, or
    service account token secrets can be manually created. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret
    ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the
    referred object.
    
FIELDS:
  apiVersion	<string>
    API version of the referent.

  fieldPath	<string>
    If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this
    string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as
    desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is
    to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container
    that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
    "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is
    chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an
    object.
