KIND:       ServiceAccount
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: imagePullSecrets <[]LocalObjectReference>


DESCRIPTION:
    ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same namespace to
    use for pulling any images in pods that reference this ServiceAccount.
    ImagePullSecrets are distinct from Secrets because Secrets can be mounted in
    the pod, but ImagePullSecrets are only accessed by the kubelet. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
    LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the
    referenced object inside the same namespace.
    
FIELDS:
  name	<string>
    Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to
    backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with
    an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info:
