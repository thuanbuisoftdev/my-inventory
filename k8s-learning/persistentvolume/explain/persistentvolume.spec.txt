    accessed from. This field influences the scheduling of pods that use this
    volume.

  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy	<string>
  enum: Delete, Recycle, Retain
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy defines what happens to a persistent volume
    when released from its claim. Valid options are Retain (default for manually
    created PersistentVolumes), Delete (default for dynamically provisioned
    PersistentVolumes), and Recycle (deprecated). Recycle must be supported by
    the volume plugin underlying this PersistentVolume. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#reclaiming
    
    Possible enum values:
     - `"Delete"` means the volume will be deleted from Kubernetes on release
    from its claim. The volume plugin must support Deletion.
     - `"Recycle"` means the volume will be recycled back into the pool of
    unbound persistent volumes on release from its claim. The volume plugin must
    support Recycling.
     - `"Retain"` means the volume will be left in its current phase (Released)
    for manual reclamation by the administrator. The default policy is Retain.

  photonPersistentDisk	<PhotonPersistentDiskVolumeSource>

  quobyte	<QuobyteVolumeSource>
    quobyte represents a Quobyte mount on the host that shares a pod's lifetime.
    Deprecated: Quobyte is deprecated and the in-tree quobyte type is no longer
    supported.

  rbd	<RBDPersistentVolumeSource>
    rbd represents a Rados Block Device mount on the host that shares a pod's
    lifetime. Deprecated: RBD is deprecated and the in-tree rbd type is no
    longer supported. More info: https://examples.k8s.io/volumes/rbd/README.md

  scaleIO	<ScaleIOPersistentVolumeSource>
    scaleIO represents a ScaleIO persistent volume attached and mounted on
    Kubernetes nodes. Deprecated: ScaleIO is deprecated and the in-tree scaleIO
    type is no longer supported.

  storageClassName	<string>
    storageClassName is the name of StorageClass to which this persistent volume
    belongs. Empty value means that this volume does not belong to any
    StorageClass.

  storageos	<StorageOSPersistentVolumeSource>
    storageOS represents a StorageOS volume that is attached to the kubelet's
    host machine and mounted into the pod. Deprecated: StorageOS is deprecated
    and the in-tree storageos type is no longer supported. More info:
    https://examples.k8s.io/volumes/storageos/README.md

  volumeAttributesClassName	<string>
    Name of VolumeAttributesClass to which this persistent volume belongs. Empty
    value is not allowed. When this field is not set, it indicates that this
    volume does not belong to any VolumeAttributesClass. This field is mutable
    and can be changed by the CSI driver after a volume has been updated
    successfully to a new class. For an unbound PersistentVolume, the
    volumeAttributesClassName will be matched with unbound
    PersistentVolumeClaims during the binding process. This is a beta field and
    requires enabling VolumeAttributesClass feature (off by default).

  volumeMode	<string>
  enum: Block, Filesystem
    volumeMode defines if a volume is intended to be used with a formatted
    filesystem or to remain in raw block state. Value of Filesystem is implied
    when not included in spec.
    
    Possible enum values:
     - `"Block"` means the volume will not be formatted with a filesystem and
    will remain a raw block device.
     - `"Filesystem"` means the volume will be or is formatted with a
    filesystem.

  vsphereVolume	<VsphereVirtualDiskVolumeSource>
    vsphereVolume represents a vSphere volume attached and mounted on kubelets
    host machine. Deprecated: VsphereVolume is deprecated. All operations for
    the in-tree vsphereVolume type are redirected to the csi.vsphere.vmware.com
    CSI driver.
