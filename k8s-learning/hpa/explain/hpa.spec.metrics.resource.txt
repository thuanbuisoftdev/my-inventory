FIELD: resource <ResourceMetricSource>


DESCRIPTION:
    resource refers to a resource metric (such as those specified in requests
    and limits) known to Kubernetes describing each pod in the current scale
    target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are built in to Kubernetes, and
    have special scaling options on top of those available to normal per-pod
    metrics using the "pods" source.
    ResourceMetricSource indicates how to scale on a resource metric known to
    Kubernetes, as specified in requests and limits, describing each pod in the
    current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory).  The values will be averaged
    together before being compared to the target.  Such metrics are built in to
    Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available to
    normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.  Only one "target" type
    should be set.
