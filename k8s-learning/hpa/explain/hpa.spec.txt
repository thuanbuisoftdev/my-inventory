GROUP:      autoscaling
KIND:       HorizontalPodAutoscaler
VERSION:    v2

FIELD: spec <HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec>


DESCRIPTION:
    spec is the specification for the behaviour of the autoscaler. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status.
    HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec describes the desired functionality of the
    HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
    
FIELDS:
  behavior	<HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior>
    behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down
    directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the
    default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used.

  maxReplicas	<integer> -required-
    maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the
    autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas.

  metrics	<[]MetricSpec>
    metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the
    desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be
    used).  The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio
    between the target value and the current value by the current number of
    pods.  Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and
    vice-versa.  See the individual metric source types for more information
    about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric
    will be set to 80% average CPU utilization.

  minReplicas	<integer>
    minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the
    autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to
    be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one
    Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at
    least one metric value is available.

  scaleTargetRef	<CrossVersionObjectReference> -required-
    scaleTargetRef points to the target resource to scale, and is used to the
    pods for which metrics should be collected, as well as to actually change
    the replica count.
