KIND:       HorizontalPodAutoscaler
VERSION:    v2

FIELD: behavior <HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior>


DESCRIPTION:
    behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down
    directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the
    default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used.
    HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior configures the scaling behavior of the
    target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields
    respectively).
    
FIELDS:
  scaleDown	<HPAScalingRules>
    scaleDown is scaling policy for scaling Down. If not set, the default value
    is to allow to scale down to minReplicas pods, with a 300 second
    stabilization window (i.e., the highest recommendation for the last 300sec
    is used).

  scaleUp	<HPAScalingRules>
    scaleUp is scaling policy for scaling Up. If not set, the default value is
    the higher of:
      * increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds
      * double the number of pods per 60 seconds
    No stabilization is used.
