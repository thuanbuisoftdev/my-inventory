# Kubernetes ResourceQuota Overview & Example

## Overview

A **ResourceQuota** in Kubernetes is used to limit resource consumption within a namespace. It ensures that workloads within a namespace do not exceed defined CPU, memory, or storage constraints. This helps in fair resource distribution across multiple teams or applications running in a shared cluster.

### Key Features:
- Limits total CPU, memory, and storage usage per namespace.
- Enforces quota on object count (e.g., number of Pods, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims).
- Ensures efficient resource utilization.

## Conclusion
ResourceQuotas help in managing resource constraints efficiently within Kubernetes namespaces, preventing resource overconsumption, and ensuring fair allocation. It is particularly useful in multi-tenant Kubernetes environments.
