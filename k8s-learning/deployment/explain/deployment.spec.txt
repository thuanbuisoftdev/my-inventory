DESCRIPTION:
    Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.
    DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the
    Deployment.
    
FIELDS:
  minReadySeconds	<integer>
    Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready
    without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available.
    Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

  paused	<boolean>
    Indicates that the deployment is paused.

  progressDeadlineSeconds	<integer>
    The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is
    considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process
    failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason
    will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be
    estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.

  replicas	<integer>
    Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit
    zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.

  revisionHistoryLimit	<integer>
    The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer
    to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.

  selector	<LabelSelector> -required-
    Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by
    this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod
    template's labels.

  strategy	<DeploymentStrategy>
    The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.

  template	<PodTemplateSpec> -required-
    Template describes the pods that will be created. The only allowed
    template.spec.restartPolicy value is "Always".
