    This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
    feature gate.
    
    This field is immutable. It can only be set for containers.

  limits	<map[string]Quantity>
    Limits describes the maximum amount of compute resources allowed. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

  requests	<map[string]Quantity>
    Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required. If
    Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is
    explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests
    cannot exceed Limits. More info:
