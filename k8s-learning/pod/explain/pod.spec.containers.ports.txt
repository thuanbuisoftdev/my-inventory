KIND:       Pod
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: ports <[]ContainerPort>


DESCRIPTION:
    List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES
    NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the
    default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the
    network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the
    data. For more information See
    https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated.
    ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.
    
FIELDS:
  containerPort	<integer> -required-
    Number of port to expose on the pod's IP address. This must be a valid port
    number, 0 < x < 65536.

  hostIP	<string>
    What host IP to bind the external port to.

  hostPort	<integer>
    Number of port to expose on the host. If specified, this must be a valid
    port number, 0 < x < 65536. If HostNetwork is specified, this must match
    ContainerPort. Most containers do not need this.

  name	<string>
    If specified, this must be an IANA_SVC_NAME and unique within the pod. Each
    named port in a pod must have a unique name. Name for the port that can be
    referred to by services.

  protocol	<string>
  enum: SCTP, TCP, UDP
    Protocol for port. Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Defaults to "TCP".
    
    Possible enum values:
