# Container Lifecycle in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, a container's lifecycle is managed by the Pod that encapsulates it. Containers go through different phases as they are created, started, and terminated. Below are the key phases of a container's lifecycle:

## Container Lifecycle Phases

1. **Waiting**: The container image is being pulled, or the container is waiting for required resources.
2. **Running**: The container is successfully created and running inside the Pod.
3. **Terminated**: The container has stopped running, either due to completion or failure.

## Container Lifecycle Hooks

Kubernetes provides lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute custom code at specific points in the container lifecycle:

- **PostStart**: Executes immediately after the container starts.
- **PreStop**: Executes just before the container is terminated.

### Example: Using Lifecycle Hooks

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: busybox
      lifecycle:
        postStart:
          exec:
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Container started!"]
        preStop:
          exec:
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Container stopping!"]
```

## Restart Policies

The container's restart behavior is controlled by the Pod's `restartPolicy` field:

- `Always` (default): The container is restarted if it exits.
- `OnFailure`: The container is restarted only if it exits with a failure (non-zero exit code).
- `Never`: The container is not restarted after exiting.

### Example: Restart Policy Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "exit 1"]
```

## Container Probes

Kubernetes uses probes to check container health:

- **Liveness Probe**: Checks if the container is still running. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
- **Readiness Probe**: Determines if the container is ready to accept traffic.
- **Startup Probe**: Helps with slow-starting applications by delaying liveness checks until startup completes.

### Example: Liveness and Readiness Probes

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 3
        periodSeconds: 5
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the container lifecycle helps in managing application availability, debugging issues, and ensuring smooth deployments. By configuring lifecycle hooks, restart policies, and probes, you can improve container reliability in Kubernetes.


# Comparing Kubernetes Container Lifecycle with Standard Container Lifecycle

## Standard Container Lifecycle
A typical container follows a lifecycle managed by a container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd):

1. **Created**: The container is created but not yet running.
2. **Running**: The container is actively executing processes.
3. **Paused**: The container's processes are frozen.
4. **Stopped**: The container has stopped execution.
5. **Exited**: The container has terminated, either due to completion or failure.
6. **Deleted**: The container is removed from the system.

## Kubernetes Container Lifecycle
Kubernetes manages containers within Pods and introduces additional states and transitions:

1. **Waiting**: The container is waiting for necessary conditions (e.g., image pull, volume mount, networking setup).
2. **Running**: The container is actively running within a Pod.
3. **Terminated**: The container has stopped, either successfully or due to failure.

### Key Differences:
| Feature                | Standard Container | Kubernetes Container |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Lifecycle Management  | Manual start/stop | Managed by Kubelet |
| Restart Policy        | Not built-in      | Configurable (`Always`, `OnFailure`, `Never`) |
| Health Checks        | External monitoring tools | Liveness, Readiness, Startup Probes |
| Orchestration        | Manual            | Automated scaling & self-healing |
| Networking           | Container-specific | Pod-based, Service-managed |
| Storage             | Ephemeral by default | Persistent storage options (PVC, EmptyDir) |

Kubernetes extends container lifecycles by integrating with orchestration, networking, and storage, making container management more robust and automated.
