# Best Practices for Kubernetes Network Policies

## 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Start with a **deny-all** policy and then add specific **allow** rules as needed.
- This ensures that only intended traffic flows between Pods, reducing attack surface.

## 2. Use Namespace Isolation
- Apply **NetworkPolicies per namespace** to restrict communication between applications in different namespaces.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: deny-all
    namespace: my-namespace
  spec:
    podSelector: {}
    policyTypes:
      - Ingress
      - Egress
  ```

## 3. Define Ingress and Egress Separately
- Specify **Ingress** (incoming) and **Egress** (outgoing) traffic explicitly to control data flow.
- Example allowing only specific app communication:
  ```yaml
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: allow-app-to-db
    namespace: my-namespace
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: database
    ingress:
      - from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: backend
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 5432
  ```

## 4. Label Pods Consistently
- Use **consistent labeling** across applications for easier NetworkPolicy management.
- Example labels:
  ```yaml
  labels:
    app: my-app
    tier: frontend
    environment: production
  ```

## 5. Limit Egress Traffic
- Restrict outbound traffic to only necessary services (e.g., external databases, APIs).
- Example restricting to a specific external IP:
  ```yaml
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: limit-egress
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
    egress:
      - to:
          - ipBlock:
              cidr: 203.0.113.0/24
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 443
  ```

## 6. Test and Validate Network Policies
- Use tools like **`kubectl exec`** or **`netshoot`** to verify policy effects.
- Example test:
  ```sh
  kubectl exec -it my-pod -- curl http://database-service:5432
  ```

## 7. Use Logging and Monitoring
- Enable **CNI plugin logs** (Calico, Cilium, etc.) to monitor network policy violations.
- Consider integrating with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **ELK stack** for insights.

## 8. Keep Policies Up to Date
- Regularly audit and refine policies as application communication changes.
- Automate policy validation in CI/CD pipelines.

By following these best practices, Kubernetes NetworkPolicies can provide robust security while maintaining efficient network communication within the cluster.
