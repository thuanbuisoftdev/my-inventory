FIELD: ingress <[]NetworkPolicyIngressRule>


DESCRIPTION:
    ingress is a list of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods.
    Traffic is allowed to a pod if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the
    pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic
    source is the pod's local node, OR if the traffic matches at least one
    ingress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector
    matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy does not
    allow any traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are
    isolated by default)
    NetworkPolicyIngressRule describes a particular set of traffic that is
    allowed to the pods matched by a NetworkPolicySpec's podSelector. The
    traffic must match both ports and from.
    
FIELDS:
  from	<[]NetworkPolicyPeer>
    from is a list of sources which should be able to access the pods selected
    for this rule. Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation.
    If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all sources (traffic
    not restricted by source). If this field is present and contains at least
    one item, this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one
    item in the from list.

  ports	<[]NetworkPolicyPort>
    ports is a list of ports which should be made accessible on the pods
    selected for this rule. Each item in this list is combined using a logical
    OR. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all ports (traffic
    not restricted by port). If this field is present and contains at least one
    item, then this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one
    port in the list.
