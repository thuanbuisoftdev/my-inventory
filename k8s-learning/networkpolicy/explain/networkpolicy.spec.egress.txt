FIELD: egress <[]NetworkPolicyEgressRule>


DESCRIPTION:
    egress is a list of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods.
    Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the
    pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic
    matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects
    whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this
    NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that
    the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in
    1.8
    NetworkPolicyEgressRule describes a particular set of traffic that is
    allowed out of pods matched by a NetworkPolicySpec's podSelector. The
    traffic must match both ports and to. This type is beta-level in 1.8
    
FIELDS:
  ports	<[]NetworkPolicyPort>
    ports is a list of destination ports for outgoing traffic. Each item in this
    list is combined using a logical OR. If this field is empty or missing, this
    rule matches all ports (traffic not restricted by port). If this field is
    present and contains at least one item, then this rule allows traffic only
    if the traffic matches at least one port in the list.

  to	<[]NetworkPolicyPeer>
    to is a list of destinations for outgoing traffic of pods selected for this
    rule. Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation. If this
    field is empty or missing, this rule matches all destinations (traffic not
    restricted by destination). If this field is present and contains at least
    one item, this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one
    item in the to list.
