FIELD: podSelector <LabelSelector>


DESCRIPTION:
    podSelector selects the pods to which this NetworkPolicy object applies. The
    array of ingress rules is applied to any pods selected by this field.
    Multiple network policies can select the same set of pods. In this case, the
    ingress rules for each are combined additively. This field is NOT optional
    and follows standard label selector semantics. An empty podSelector matches
    all pods in this namespace.
    A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of
    matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches
    all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.
    
FIELDS:
  matchExpressions	<[]LabelSelectorRequirement>
    matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements
    are ANDed.

  matchLabels	<map[string]string>
    matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the
    matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key
    field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only
    "value". The requirements are ANDed.
