FIELD: from <[]NetworkPolicyPeer>


DESCRIPTION:
    from is a list of sources which should be able to access the pods selected
    for this rule. Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation.
    If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all sources (traffic
    not restricted by source). If this field is present and contains at least
    one item, this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one
    item in the from list.
    NetworkPolicyPeer describes a peer to allow traffic to/from. Only certain
    combinations of fields are allowed
    
FIELDS:
  ipBlock	<IPBlock>
    ipBlock defines policy on a particular IPBlock. If this field is set then
    neither of the other fields can be.

  namespaceSelector	<LabelSelector>
    namespaceSelector selects namespaces using cluster-scoped labels. This field
    follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects
    all namespaces.
    
    If podSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects
    the pods matching podSelector in the namespaces selected by
    namespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects all pods in the namespaces selected
    by namespaceSelector.

  podSelector	<LabelSelector>
    podSelector is a label selector which selects pods. This field follows
    standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all
    pods.
    
    If namespaceSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole
    selects the pods matching podSelector in the Namespaces selected by
    NamespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects the pods matching podSelector in the
    policy's own namespace.
