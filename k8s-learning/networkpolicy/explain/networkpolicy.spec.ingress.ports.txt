FIELD: ports <[]NetworkPolicyPort>


DESCRIPTION:
    ports is a list of ports which should be made accessible on the pods
    selected for this rule. Each item in this list is combined using a logical
    OR. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all ports (traffic
    not restricted by port). If this field is present and contains at least one
    item, then this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one
    port in the list.
    NetworkPolicyPort describes a port to allow traffic on
    
FIELDS:
  endPort	<integer>
    endPort indicates that the range of ports from port to endPort if set,
    inclusive, should be allowed by the policy. This field cannot be defined if
    the port field is not defined or if the port field is defined as a named
    (string) port. The endPort must be equal or greater than port.

  port	<IntOrString>
    port represents the port on the given protocol. This can either be a
    numerical or named port on a pod. If this field is not provided, this
    matches all port names and numbers. If present, only traffic on the
    specified protocol AND port will be matched.

  protocol	<string>
  enum: SCTP, TCP, UDP
    protocol represents the protocol (TCP, UDP, or SCTP) which traffic must
    match. If not specified, this field defaults to TCP.
    
    Possible enum values:
     - `"SCTP"` is the SCTP protocol.
     - `"TCP"` is the TCP protocol.
     - `"UDP"` is the UDP protocol.
