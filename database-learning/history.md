# Overview of Database History

## 1. Early Databases (1950s-1960s)

- **Punch Cards & Magnetic Tapes**: Data was stored sequentially.
- **Hierarchical Databases** (e.g., IBM IMS): Data was structured like a tree.
- **Network Databases** (e.g., CODASYL DBTG): Used graph-like structures with pointers.

## 2. Relational Databases (1970s-1980s)

- **Edgar F. Codd introduced the Relational Model (1970).**
- **SQL (Structured Query Language) was developed.**
- Popular databases: Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL.

## 3. Object-Oriented Databases (1980s-1990s)

- Combined database concepts with Object-Oriented Programming.
- Used for complex data structures, but adoption remained niche.

## 4. NoSQL Movement (2000s-Present)

- Driven by web-scale applications needing flexible schema & scalability.
- Categories:
  - **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis, Amazon DynamoDB)
  - **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)
  - **Column-Family Stores** (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase)
  - **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB)

## 5. New Trends in Databases (2010s-Present)

- **NewSQL**: Combines SQL reliability with NoSQL scalability (e.g., CockroachDB, Google Spanner).
- **Distributed Databases**: Cloud-native databases (e.g., Firebase, FaunaDB, YugabyteDB).
- **Blockchain Databases**: Immutable, decentralized storage (e.g., BigchainDB).
- **Vector Databases**: Optimized for AI/ML (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus).

## Conclusion

Database technology has evolved from simple hierarchical structures to complex distributed and AI-driven systems, shaping the modern data-driven world.
